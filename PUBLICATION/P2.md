**_Abstract_**: The urban forest is a green area in urban areas overgrown with woody vegetation and provides physiological, sociological, economic, and aesthetic benefits for urban communities. Unfortunately, urban forest change is still happening everywhere, especially in Jabodetabek Megacity until now, and is a problem because the arrangement of cities is more in favor of economic interests. This is considered to be the main cause of runoff, flooding, and erosion which in turn causes reduced air supply and increased air pollution which can change the microclimate of urban areas. Research is needed to detect how many changes in urban forests in Jabodetabek Megacity are so that the changes can be controlled. This research is based on the application of the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform with data sources in the form of Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI satellite imagery. Classification of land use through the Random Forest algorithm method with the help of several indexes is carried out to obtain the area of the yard of the vegetation that is part of the urban forest. The results of this study are expected as recommendations and considerations in making policies to manage urban forests and minimize the impact of urban communities.
